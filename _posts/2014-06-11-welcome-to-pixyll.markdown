Hello.

This will be a rarely updated blog, I've started it for two reasons

- There's sometimes things we build at Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research that might be handy to other charities. This can be a place I can write about and share them.

- A place to writeup some of the [Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/) projects that I'm trying to do. Writing them up helps solidify the learnings.
