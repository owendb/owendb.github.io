## 

I'm Owen, I work in the Insight Team at the blood cancer charity [Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research](https://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/). This will be a rarely updated blog about data, analytics, fundraising and code to do with the charity sector. I've started it for two reasons :

- There's sometimes things we build at Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research that might be handy to other charities. This can be a place I can write about and share them.

- A place to writeup some of the [Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/) projects I'm working on in the hope it'll solidify learning.



Built on Jekyll using GitHub Pages and the [pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) theme.
