##Intro

This tool has been designed to let multiple users across an organisation add Google Analytics URL tracking to their links in a consistent way that doesn't require indepth knowledge of Google Analyics. Resulting in clean crisp campaign data in Google Analytics and people not having to worry about whether something is a 'medium' or a 'source'. It's a suped up but simplified version of <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">this</a>. As a bonus it's got built in Bit.ly shortening


## Background

Previous to moving to the charity sector I did digital marketing at a fairly mature ecommerce startup. Practically all marketing was via digital channels and anyone posting links on social media or in emails was au fait with Google Analytics. This meant that all the links were tracked with campaign tracking I.E. adding tracking text about the link and where it was being placed onto the end of the link like this

Moving to the charity sector and a bigger organisation I found it difficult to get everyone trackin links in a consistant way. Press and fundraising don't use GA but might well be tweeting. If you're not using GA it's not surprising if you don't know the difference between a source and a medium, even naming campaigns can become tricky as there can be a number of ways to write the same thing :

* LondonMarathon
* Thelondonmarathon
* Marathon2015

To solve some of these issues we rewrote <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">this</a> so that users just get to select from dropdowns, removing choice and confusion and leaving consistant tracked links. Thanks to Tom from Royal Marsden for getting me to send him my half finished work that he finished and Jim for sorting some Javascript.
