## Intro
I built a webpage tool to replace <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033867?hl=en-GB" target="_blank">this</a> so that users can paste in a link and get the url parameters they need to track their campaign in Google Analytics. It's been designed to let multiple users across an organisation add tracking in a consistent way that doesn't require them to have any knowledge of Google Analytics. Resulting in clean crisp campaign data having to worry about _email_ being both _utm&#95;medium_ and _utm&#95;source_ or completely missing. 

* Here's a demo of it. 
* Download it as a zip here (with setup instructions). 
* Fork it on GitHub here.


## Background

Previous to moving to the charity sector I did digital marketing at a mature ecommerce startup. Practically all marketing was via digital channels and anyone posting links on social media or in emails was au fait with Google Analytics as they were in the digital marketing team. So all links went out with nice campaign url parameters added like this: 

> http://www.example.com?utm&#95;source=newsletter&utm&#95;medium=email&utm&#95;content=topbanner

However moving to the charity sector (or perhaps just a bigger organisation) I found it difficult to get everyone tracking links in a consistant way. The press team and sports fundraising team don't use Google Analytics, however both could well be tweeting links or writing external web content. Training changing teams on camapaign parameters was difficult and even if you can get that bit trained you might end up with lots of different ways of spelling a campaign. E.G. 

* LondonMarathon
* Thelondonmarathon
* Marathon2015

To solve some of these issues we built a tool so that users just select from dropdowns, removing the elements of choice that led to bad data. Source and medium get set as one selection and campaigns are limited to defined campaigns, have a look at the demo, it'll explain it better.
