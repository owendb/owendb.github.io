Hello.

I'm Owen, I work in the Insight Team at the blood cancer charity Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research. This will be a rarely updated blog, I've started it for two reasons

- There's sometimes things we build at Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research that might be handy to other charities. This can be a place I can write about and share them.

- A place to writeup some of the [Coursera] (https://www.coursera.org/) projects that I'm trying to do. Writing them up helps me solidify the learning.

## Stack

Built on Jekyll using Git hub papes and the [pixyll](https://github.com/johnotander/pixyll) theme.
