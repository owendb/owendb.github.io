A place to share some bits. I'm Owen, I work in the Insight Team at the blood cancer charity [Leukaemia & Lymphoma Research](https://leukaemialymphomaresearch.org.uk/). This will be a rarely updated blog about data, analytics, fundraising and code to do with the charity sector. Mainly bits of code or research that might be useful to other charities or non profits.
